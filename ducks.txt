Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the Anatidae family of birds, which also includes swans and geese. 
The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; 
they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, 
since swans and geese are not considered ducks. 
Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
The word duck comes from Old English *dūce "diver", a derivative of the verb *dūcan "to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive", 
because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen "to dive".
